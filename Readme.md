# Row Layout Editor

_An intuitive, fast, in-browser, image layout preview tool for testing layout ideas for magazines, blogs, or websites._

Drag and drop image files from your Desktop into the browser window to load them into a fluid row layout. Drag and drop images to re-order them or create new rows. Click an image to remove it. That's it.

## Demo

Go to: [kristianhentschel.github.io/row-layout-editor](http://kristianhentschel.github.io/row-layout-editor/)

No image files are uploaded nor is any personal data sent to a server - everything stays in the local browser.


## Not yet implemented

* Controls for margin between images and layout preview width
* Automatic re-layout on window size change
* Save/Restore a layout, maybe using local storage?
* Alternative image import UI, as drag and drop cannot work on mobile.
